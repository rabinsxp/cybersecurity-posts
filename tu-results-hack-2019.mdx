## The Incident
In 2019, the credibility of Nepal's oldest university, **Tribhuvan University (TU)**, was severely questioned. The website of the TU Service Commission was compromised, and there were allegations and evidence that the results of competitive exams for administrative positions had been manipulated.

## Technical Analysis
This incident centers on the **Integrity** pillar of the CIA Triad. Unlike a DDoS (Availability) or a Data Leak (Confidentiality), this attack altered data to benefit specific individuals.

### The Attack Surface
1.  **Weak Web Access Controls**: The backend system managing the results likely lacked sufficient logging and role-based access control (RBAC).
2.  **SQL Injection (Suspected)**: Attackers or insiders potentially used SQL injection or direct database access to modify scores.
3.  **Insider Threat**: Given the specific nature of the changes (targeting specific candidates), insider involvement or compromised admin credentials was highly probable.

## Impact
*   **Loss of Trust**: The integrity of the entire examination process was shattered.
*   **Legal Action**: The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) launched investigations.
*   **Operational Halt**: Recruitment processes were stalled for months.

## Key Lessons
1.  **Immutable Audit Logs**: Any change to a "Score" field in a database must write to a separate, append-only log file (or blockchain ledger) that cannot be altered by the database admin.
2.  **Input Validation**: Strict validation on all data entry forms.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Database write access should be restricted to the bare minimum number of applications/users.
