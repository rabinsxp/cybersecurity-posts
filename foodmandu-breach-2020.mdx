## The Incident
In March 2020, Foodmandu, Nepal's leading food delivery service, fell victim to a significant data breach. A hacker, using the Twitter handle "Mr. Mugger," claimed responsibility for dumping the personal details of approximately **50,000 customers**.

The dumped data included:
*   Full Names
*   Email Addresses
*   Phone Numbers
*   Delivery Addresses

## Technical Analysis
While the full post-mortem was never publicly released in granular detail, security researchers analysis points to a classic **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** or a generic SQL Injection vulnerability in their web API.

### The Attack Vector
The attacker likely identified an endpoint that retrieved user details based on a sequential ID (e.g., `/api/user/12345`). By iterating through these IDs (Enumeration), the attacker could scrape the database without authentication checks on whether the requestor owned that data.

This highlights a critical failure in **Broken Access Control** (OWASP Top 10 A01).

## Impact
The immediate impact was a loss of trust. For users, the exposure of phone numbers and physical addresses created a risk of targeted phishing (smishing) and potential harassment. For Foodmandu, it served as a wake-up call to the startup ecosystem in Nepal that "security through obscurity" is not a strategy.

## Lessons Learned
1.  **Rate Limiting**: Simple rate limiting on API endpoints could have flagged or blocked the rapid enumeration of 50,000 records.
2.  **Access Control**: Ensure that `user_id` parameters in API calls are checked against the currently logged-in user's session.
3.  **VAPT**: Regular Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing would likely have caught such a basic enumeration flaw.
