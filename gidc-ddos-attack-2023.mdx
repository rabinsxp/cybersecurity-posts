## The Incident
On January 28, 2023, Nepal witnessed a crippling cyberattack on its **Government Integrated Data Centre (GIDC)**. The attack took down hundreds of government websites, but most critically, it crashed the immigration server at **Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA)**.

For hours, international flights were grounded, and passengers were stranded because immigration officials could not process visas or entry logs digitally.

## Technical Analysis
The attack was identified as a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack.

### The Mechanism
Attackers flooded the GIDC's bandwidth with an overwhelming volume of traffic, saturating the "pipe." The GIDC, at the time, lacked sufficient upstream bandwidth filtering or a dedicated **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** scrubbing service closer to the edge.

When the central gateway at GIDC was choked, every service hosted behind it—from the Prime Minister's portal to the Airport's immigration database—went offline. This reveals a "Single Point of Failure" architecture.

## Why It Mattered
This wasn't just a website defacement; it was a denial of critical national infrastructure. It highlighted the fragility of Nepal's digital sovereignty.

## Lessons for Enterprise
1.  **DDoS Mitigation is Mandatory**: For critical infrastructure, ISP-level filtering is not enough. Dedicated scrubbing services (like Cloudflare Magic Transit or Akamai Prolexic) are required.
2.  **Decouple Critical Systems**: The airport's immigration system should not share the exact same ingress pipe as public-facing static websites. Critical systems need dedicated, redundant connectivity.
3.  **Failover Drills**: Physical redundant links existed but likely failed to switch over seamlessly under load. Regular drill testing is essential.
